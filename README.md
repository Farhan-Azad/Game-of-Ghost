Objective: Be the last player remaining after others have been eliminated.
Setup: Two or more players take turns in sequence
The game uses a dictionary of valid words (at least 4 letters long)

Players take turns adding a single letter to a growing sequence
Each letter added must form the beginning of a valid word
The sequence of letters cannot form a complete word (4+ letters)

At any point, a player can challenge the previous player by entering "*"
A challenge claims either:

No valid word begins with the current sequence of letters, OR
The previous player completed a valid word

A player loses if they complete a valid word (4+ letters)
A player loses if they are successfully challenged (no valid word starts with the current letters)
A player loses if they challenge incorrectly (a valid word does exist)


When a player loses a round, they receive one letter of the word "GHOST"
Players are eliminated when they have all 5 letters ("GHOST" complete)


The last player remaining after all others have been eliminated wins the game
